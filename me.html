    Hi, I'm Alexander Niklass, a 23-years-old Communication Design Student
    based in Berlin. I was born in Ulaan Bataar and moved to Germany when I was
    3 years old. Since my childhood I have done creative stuff of all kind.
    I was raised in a small northern German town and after an apprenticeship
    I decided to make my hobby becoming professional.
    So I enroled myself in the HTW Berlin in Oktober 2015.
    Since then I started to take pictures of moody moments in Berlin.
    I like to create a feeling of loneliness and anonymity in the photos
    which are taking place mostly at night.
    I hope you enjoy them and stay tuned for some awesome illustrations in
    near future!
